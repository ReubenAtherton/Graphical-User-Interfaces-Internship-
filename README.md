# InternshipGUI-Python

This project was completely independent and is the result of self-teaching. Completing this project massively developed my Python, SQL and C# skills whilst providing valuable insight into the GUI developement process. I understand there are many improvements to be made and I aim to develop my OOP skills in the future. 


## Overall Combined Utility

### Uploading to Database
A technician would perform a product test on the shop and enter the results into these pre-made GUI (Python) sheets. When submitted, the data is then sent to a normalised SQL Server database.

### Searching Database
Engineers would uses the C# application to search for specific test results stored within the database. Enables rapid, organised data collection.

This programme was the first steps within the company to digitise a previously unefficient task. After every product test, the information within these pages would be manually updated by hand and then later entered into a database. With this GUI, granted the user has filled the required fields of entry, the data will immediately be sent into the database using SQL queries within SQL Server. Whilst not all pages have been included, the ones that have been included can be used to prove the scalability of the project.
