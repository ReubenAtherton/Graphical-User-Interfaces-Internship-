# InternshipGUI-Python

This project was completely independent and is the result of self-teaching. Completing this project massively developed my Python and SQL skills whilst providing valuable insight into the GUI developement process. I understand there are many improvements to be made and I aim to develop my OOP skills in the future. 


### Functionality

I created this GUI as part of my summer internship work. I have removed company sensitive details from the pages and replaced them with general labels.
This programme was the first steps within the company to digitise a previously unefficient task. After every product test, the information within these pages would be manually updated by hand and then later entered into a database. With this GUI, granted the user has filled the required fields of entry, the data will immediately be sent into the database using SQL queries within SQL Server. Whilst not all pages have been included, the ones that have been included can be used to prove the scalability of the project.
