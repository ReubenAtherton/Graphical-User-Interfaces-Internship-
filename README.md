# InternshipGUI-Python

My first graphical user interface. 
Front end created using Tkinter in Python and back end uses SQL Express Server.

This project was completely independent and is the result of self-teaching. Completing this project massively developed my Python and SQL skills whilst providing valuable 
insight into GUI developement. I understand Tkinter is not very applicable within the industry, however I believe this was a good place to start, considering I
had zero prior experience with this style of project. I understand there are many improvements to be made and I aim to develop my OOP skills in the future.
