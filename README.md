# InternshipGUI-Python

My first graphical user interface project.

This project was completely independent and is the result of self-teaching. Completing this project massively developed my Python and SQL skills whilst providing valuable insight into the GUI developement process. I understand Tkinter is not very applicable within the industry, however I believe it is a a good beginners tool and was a great place to start, considering I had zero prior experience with this style of project. I understand there are many improvements to be made and I aim to develop my OOP skills in the future.
