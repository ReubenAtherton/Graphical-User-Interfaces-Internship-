# GUI Created within Visual Studio and C#

Inlcudes only the screenshot of the final product. I have not yet managed to add the code but this is something I am working on.

### Functionality

This project allowed engineers to search and retrieve information stored on the database displaying the contents in the central form as shown in the screenshot.
The heading and menu bars are static, allowing for user entry and displaying general test information. The actual test results are found in the white space which changes relative to the searched product. 

The screenshots includes dummy data that I used to check the alignment of certain datatypes.

Again, company sensitive information has been removed for privacy reasons but you can still see the general design.
